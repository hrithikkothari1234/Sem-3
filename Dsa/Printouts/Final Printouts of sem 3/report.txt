			HV's Social Media App
	
An app created by implementing various data structures in C that can help connect 
strangers , friends , family , far-away relatives ,etc. They can Register , 
Login and then add other registered users as friends.
There's an option for logging into the admin panel which is restricted only to the 
admin and the admin can remove registered users i.e. delete their accounts permanently.
Some features that are going to be added to this app : Adding posts , sending messages , 
and a lot more!

Stay tuned!
